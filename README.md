This is an After Effects to F1 exporter. There is a companion module [ae-to-f1](https://github.com/Jam3/ae-to-f1) which is used on the frontend and contains all logic that will be shared by all exported After Effects f1 instances.

In other words the workflow for the exporter will be to exporter the After Effects component and then in the project install `ae-to-f1`.
